## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities via **[Email](mailto:jan.untersander@ost.ch)**, instead of using the issue tracker.

We will try to come back to you within 24 hours, but sometimes it can take up to a month. If the issue is confirmed, we'll release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity.
