# k8s operator devcontainer
Devcontainer for building Kubernetes operators based on [operator-sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/) and [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/).
This devcontainer is mainly used for developing the [Lab Topology Builder K8s Operator](https://github.com/Lab-Topology-Builder/LTB-K8s-Backend), but we're open to move it and have a more general version live somewhere else.
